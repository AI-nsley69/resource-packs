My personal texture pack for minecraft

## Current textures

Menu background is quartz brick

Hotbar is themed after logs

Server, resource pack and world buttons are wool textured

Enchantment glint is rainbow

Endermen texture change (Credit to u/Thorolhugil on reddit for it, it's not my texture)

Shields are more like dark oak

Subtle redstone block animations
